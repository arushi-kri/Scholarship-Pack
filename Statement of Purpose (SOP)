Applicant: Arushi Kumari
Program: Bachelor’s in Artificial Intelligence Engineering

> From a young age, I have been fascinated by how machines move, think, and create. My diploma in Mechanical Engineering strengthened my love for design and precision — from crafting detailed 3D models in Fusion 360 to simulating manufacturing processes through CAM. Yet, as I explored automation and intelligent systems, I realized that the future of engineering lies at the intersection of mechanics and artificial intelligence. That realization inspired me to pursue AI Engineering, where logic meets creativity and design meets intelligence.

During my studies and training at NCC Ltd., I gained real-world experience in maintenance engineering, water systems, and solar-powered installations. These experiences developed my discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. Simultaneously, I began exploring the digital side of engineering — building my first AI chatbot assistant, an image classifier, and a robotic arm simulation. Through these projects, I discovered the thrill of making systems not just move, but think.

My academic foundation in mechanical systems, combined with hands-on CAD/CAM design and self-taught AI projects, allows me to approach problems from both hardware and algorithmic perspectives. This multidisciplinary approach, I believe, defines the next generation of engineers. I aspire to specialize in intelligent robotics and sustainable automation — areas that merge design, efficiency, and innovation to solve real-world problems.

I am seeking admission and a full scholarship to develop my technical and creative potential at an elite institution. With strong determination, consistent academic performance, and an evolving project portfolio, I am confident that I will contribute meaningfully to your university’s global community.

My goal is not only to learn but also to create — to design smarter systems that bridge human intelligence and machine precision. I am ready to put in the work, collaborate across disciplines, and grow into an engineer capable of shaping the future through AI.
